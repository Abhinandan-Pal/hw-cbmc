============
Minor things
===========

*) Add a file describing options

*) Polish 'makefile'

=====================================
Changes of the current implementation
=====================================

*) Implement actual removal of subsumed clauses
   (currently they are just marked in ignored by the algorithm)

*) Add code exploiting invariant constraints (that is allowed by the
   new AIG format)

====================================
Improvements of the basic algorithm
====================================

*) Implement a more advanced technique
   of inductive clause generalization based
   on the notion of CTGs (counterexamples
   To Generalizations)


*) Implement IC3 with stuttering


*) Fix the hole in IC3 that hurts
   its convergence rate
