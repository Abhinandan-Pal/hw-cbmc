*) To create a binary called 'ic3' run

   cd minisat ; make ; cd ..

   make 


*) Synopsys


   ic3 file_name  [options]

  'file_name' gives the name of the file specifying 'circuit +
   property' in the AIG or BLIF format.  If 'file_name' has extension
   '.aig' (respectively '.blif') the file is assumed to be given in
   the AIG (respectively BLIF) format.


*) To list options run 'ic3' without any parameters


   
*) For a multi-property example, to check  k-th property, run

  ic3 file_name p'k'

  Property count starts with 0. So, to check  the very first property, run

  ic3 file_name p0

  If no parameter p'k' is specified, ic3 assumes that k = 0.


*) To ignore constraints of 'file_name' (if any), use option N.
   Sometimes, using constrains slows ic3 down.   If a property holds
   with option N, it also holds in a smaller search space specified by
   the constraints.

   However, if a property does not hold with option N, it may still
   hold if constraints are taken into account. So, one needs to run
   this example again without option N.
