*) This directory contains the code of a model checker that is 
   a variation of Aaron Bradley's IC3.  It is incorporated into
   ebmc. To invoke IC3, run

   ebmc verilog_file --ic3

*) Integration is not over yet. This current version is missing two
   features that has been implemented in the stand-alone version.
   The current version assumes that the input verilog file specifies
   only one property and has no constraints.
